\usage{
diffRegionsWithPerm(count, bins = NULL, meta = NULL, design, sizefac,
  rccut = 15, fccut = 0.4, gap = 2, permute = NULL, maxperm = 10,
  diffmeth = c("DESeq2", "limma", "ttest"))
}
\arguments{
\item{count}{A matrix of read counts or a RangedSummarizedExperiment, where
columns are samples and rows are genome-wide bins. This object can be
generated by function \code{regionReads}.}

\item{bins}{If \code{count} is a read count matrix, \code{bins} should be
provided as a GRanges object recording bins of corresponding rows in
\code{count}. If \code{count} is a RangedSummarizedExperiment, this
parameter will be ignored.}

\item{meta}{If \code{count} is a read count matrix, this should be a
DataFrame object recording sample annotations. Rows of \code{meta}
correspond to the columns of \code{count}. The \code{design} parameter
treats the column names of \code{meta} as variables. If \code{count} is a
RangedSummarizedExperiment, this parameter will be ignored.}

\item{design}{A formula object which expresses how read counts for each bin
depend on the variables in \code{meta}, e.g. '~ group + condition' etc. Or,
if \code{count} is a RangedSummarizedExperiment, the bins and meta objects
will be extracted by \code{rowRanges()} and \code{colData()} from
\code{count} object. By default, the last variable in \code{design} formula
will be used to build the differential binding contrast. At most two
variables are allowed if \code{diffmeth} is set to 'ttest'. (Details see
below)}

\item{sizefac}{A numeric vector indicating estimated size of samples for
normalization purpose. This vector can be generated by function
\code{sizeFac}.}

\item{rccut}{A numeric cutoff on normalized count matrix using
\code{sizefac}. If positive, only bins with normalized counts larger than
\code{rccut} in at least one sample are selected for fold change estimate.
Unlike other functions in this package, moderate cutoff would be better
as too large results more false negative and too small increases the time
cost. (Default: 15)}

\item{fccut}{A numeric cutoff on smoothed log2foldchanges of bins for
bump hunting of differtial binding regions. Neighbor bins with fold change
larger than this value will be merged together with allowed gaps.
(Default: 0.4)}

\item{gap}{A integer specifying the gaps allowed for bin merging, in the
unit of number of bins. (Default: 2)}

\item{permute}{A matrix where each row contains shuffled indices of all
samples. If \code{NULL}, permutation is automatically obtained by shuffling
samples between compared conditions. This object can be generated by using
R-package \code{permute} as well.}

\item{maxperm}{Maximum number of permutations to be finished. (Default:10)}

\item{diffmeth}{Method for statistical testing of differential binding.
(Default: 'DESeq2')}
}
\value{
A GRanges object containing potential regions with differential binding, as
well as statistical significances as meta columns.
}
\description{
This function does differential binding estimation and additional
permutation analysis. This function works only if multiple replicates are
provided for comparison; otherwise, it is the same as \code{diffRegions}
which is the main function for differential binding estimation. Permutation
analysis is obtained by shuffling samples between compared conditions.
Customized shuffling can also be specified by parameter \code{permute} for
complicated experiment designs.
}
\details{
Three methods are provided for significance estimation of differential
binding. \code{DESeq2} allows pseudo-estimation for comparisons without
replicates; otherwise, all methods can be used for comparisons with at least
two replicates. The \code{design} formula can be specified as suggested by
\code{DESeq2} and \code{limma} if these two methods are selected. For
\code{ttest}, \code{design} can either contain one or two components,
referring to student's t-test or paired t-test based on logarithm scaled
data. For consistance with other packages, the last component in
\code{design} formula is the contrast on which the final differential
estimation are reported.

The default permutation works on the main contrast only (the last component
in \code{design} formula). If customized permutation needed, e.g. invloving
several components in \code{design} formula, users should provided the
customized indecies of permutations through parameter \code{permute}.
