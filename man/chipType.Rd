\title{Determine ChIP-Seq Type of Protein Complex Binding}
\usage{
chipType(count, cutoff = 50L, fold = 10, h = 0.1, plot = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{count}{A two-column matrix of read counts for peaks or
high coverage bins, where columns are samples and rows are peaks
or bins. This matrix can be generated by function \code{regionReads}.}

\item{cutoff}{A numeric cut off on \code{count} matrix. If positive,
only peaks/bins with counts larger than \code{cutoff} in at least one
sample are used to estimate the binding type. We recommend a larger
cutoff since background signal can dramatically mask the right estimation
of kernal density, especially for deep sequenced ChIP-seq samples.
(Default: 50)}

\item{fold}{A numeric threshold to help determining the binding type.
In detail, if top two estimated modes on smoothed kernal density have
a height differece less than the folds given by \code{fold}, binding
type will be determined as bimodel; otherwise, it is unimodel. This
number should be larger than 1. (Default: 10)}

\item{h}{Initial smoothing factor when estimating kernal density of
raw fold changes for bump hunting. (Default: 0.1)}

\item{plot}{A logical indicator that if M-A plot and smoothed kernal
density should be visualized. (Default: TRUE)}
}
\value{
A character with value either "bimodel" or "unimodel" to represent
estimated binding type.
}
\description{
Estimate the types of protein complex binding. Protein
complex binding might act similarly to normal transcription factors,
where the changes are symmetrical between two biological
conditions (unimodel on fold changes); or the changes might be
globally one-side accompanied with some non-changing bindings (bimodel
on fold changes). This function help to determine the binding type of
given ChIP-Seq samples from two biological conditions using kernal
density information of raw fold changes. As this function
was designed to work on the raw counts (no normalization needed),
only one replicate from each condition is allowed (input a two-column
count matrix); otherwise, coverage difference acorss replicates
might bias determination.
